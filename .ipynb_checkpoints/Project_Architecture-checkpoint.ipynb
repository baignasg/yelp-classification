    "\n",
    "1. For the overall cleaned reviews dataset, we graph a histogram of reviews in order to get a general idea for how the ratings for reviews are distributed.\n",
    "2. For the overall cleaned restaurant dataset, we grapha  histogram of restaurant ratings in order to get a general idea of how restaurant ratings are distributed. Ex-ante, we expect both distributions to closely follow each other (i.e. have a low Kullback-Leibler divergence).\n",
    "3. For each state, we perform steps 1 & 2 in order to get a general sense of how the ratings distribution for both reviews and restaurants differs across states.\n",
    "4. The restaurant dataset contains longitude and latitude coordinates. We are interested in the concentration of restaurant ratings. That is, we set longitude as the Y axis and latitutde as the X axis. Next, we create a mapping from a set of 5 different colors to the rating set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. We plot each restaurant on this graph. The result is a \"heat map\" of restaurants for each state.\n",
    "5. For the overall cleaned reviews and cleaned restaurant datsets we find basic statistics such as:\n",
    "    * Mean\n",
    "    * Median\n",

We use our DC-area restaurants and associated reviews as the test set.\n",

    "Furthermore, depending on the classification algorithm used, the top features have interpretative results. For example, with a linear support vector machine the absolute value of the coefficient weights of each feature given an indication of how important each feature was in classification relative to the other features. This arises because a linear SVM relies on a separating hyperplane in separating the classes. Feature weights are the elements of an orthogonal vector to this hyperplane. \n"
